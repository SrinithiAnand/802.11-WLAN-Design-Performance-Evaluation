# 802.11 WLAN Design & Performance Evaluation

This project designs an enterprise-grade WLAN for a multi-storey building using Wi-Fi 6 and evaluates performance using the OMNeT++ network simulator.

## ✅ Key Objectives
- Support 250 peak users per floor
- Maintain 150 Mbps per user
- Ensure WPA3 wireless security
- Minimise congestion and latency

## ✅ Simulation
- Tool: OMNeT++
- Standard: IEEE 802.11n
- Scenario: 10–100 wireless stations
- Data rates tested: 54 / 130 / 300 Mbps
- Metrics: Throughput performance under load

## ✅ Results
- Throughput decreases with increasing stations due to congestion and channel contention
- Recommended improvements: channel planning, AP density optimisation, QoS, MU-MIMO, OFDMA
